# **Molecular Analysis Toolkit**

The **Molecular Analysis Toolkit** is a collection of Python scripts designed to facilitate the study of diffusion behavior of specific atomic species in complex systems, allowing researchers to unravel intra and interchain diffusion mechanisms.

The toolkit is tailored for researchers seeking to understand the diffusion behavior of specific atomic species or groups of atoms within complex systems. By focusing on the analysis of diffusion mechanisms, this toolkit provides valuable insights into intra and interchain diffusion processes, enabling researchers to identify the governing factors behind the movement of atoms of interest.

Designed with flexibility in mind, the Molecular Analysis Toolkit can be applied to various research contexts, such as the study of Li diffusion in solid polymer electrolytes. By simplifying the processing and analysis of molecular dynamics simulation data, this toolkit allows users to efficiently extract relevant information about the diffusion pathways and behavior of their target species. With this valuable information, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the diffusion process and make informed decisions for the design and optimization of materials and systems.

## **Description**

This toolkit consists of three Python scripts that work in tandem to process and analyze molecular dynamics simulation data, providing insights into the diffusion behavior of target atomic species or groups of atoms within complex systems. Researchers can use this toolkit to study a wide range of systems, such as understanding Li diffusion in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) or investigating other target species in various contexts.

## **Installation**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies: NetworkX, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## **Scripts**

### **1. ChainExtractor.py**

- **Description**: Extracts and classifies atomic chains or molecules from a provided dataset based on connectivity information.
- **Input**: CSV file containing atomic connectivity data. (This data be extracted simply from the "Bonds" section of your lammps data file).
- **Output**: CSV file with extracted chains and their classifications.

### **2. ClosestChainFinder.py**

- **Description**: Identifies the closest atomic chains or molecules to a target species within the simulation, and plots their positions.
- **Input**: LAMMPS trajectory (lammpstrj) file and the output file generated by ChainExtractor.py.
- **Output**: 3D plot of the closest atomic chains or molecules to the target species. Each color corresponds to a different chain the diffusing atom is coordinating with.

### **3. DistanceAnalyzer.py**

- **Description**: Calculates the total distance traveled by each target atomic species over the course of the simulation and provides a sorted list of distances.
- **Input**: LAMMPS trajectory (lammpstrj) file.
- **Output**: Text file containing the sorted list of distances traveled by the target species.

## **Usage**

1. Place your input data (CSV file and LAMMPS trajectory file) in the same directory as the scripts.
2. Modify the scripts as needed to specify the following variables:
   - `target_species`: Atom ID of the target (diffusing) atom for analysis.
   - `type_ids`: Vector containing atom ID types corresponding to the forcefields of the atoms on the polymer chains that typically coordinate with the diffusing atom.
   - `num_neighbors`: Specify how many of the closest atoms (of type ID specified above) to the target atom will be considered.
   - `num_atoms`: Number of atoms in your system.
   - `trj_file`: Name of your LAMMPS trajectory file.
   - `x`: Analyze every xth timestep in your simulation.
   - `y`: Max number of timesteps to analyze.
(**Please note** that these scripts assume a 9-line spacing between the last row of the preceding timestep and the first row of the current timestep in the LAMMPS trajectory file. Depending on the specific format of your trajectory file, you can easily adjust this value to match your file's format.)
3. Run the scripts in the following order: ChainExtractor.py, ClosestChainFinder.py, and DistanceAnalyzer.py.
4. The output files generated by the scripts will provide information on the extracted chains, the closest chains to the target species, and the distances traveled by the target species.
